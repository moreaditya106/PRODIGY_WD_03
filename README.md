# Tic Tac Toe Web Application

This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play against each other in a classic 3x3 grid format, aiming to get three of their markers (X or O) in a row to win.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode:** Two players can take turns playing the game.
- **Responsive Design:** The game is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Winning and Draw Conditions:** The game checks for winning combinations and announces the result. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
- **Restart Button:** A button to reset the game board and start a new match.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For structuring the web page.
- **CSS:** For styling the game board and elements.
- **JavaScript:** For implementing the game logic, including player turns, checking for win/draw conditions, and restarting the game.
